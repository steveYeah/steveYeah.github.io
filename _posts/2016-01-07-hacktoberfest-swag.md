Hacktoberfest is an annual event held by the guys at Digital Ocean. It's been going for two years (including 2015) 
and aims to get people contributing to open source software. Last year GitHub partnered up with Digital Ocean 
to help push things along. As the name suggests, it's a challenge to coders, hackers and hobbyists, run over 
the month of October, to make 4 pull requests on any open source projects. For those that 
complete the challenge you get a free T-Shirt! Shweet!

Last year I decided to give it a go. I wanted to write a simple open source monitoring tool for RabbitMQ but
just hadn't found the time. So I used the challenge as the kick I needed to get started. By the end of the 
month I had a fully working project with about 5 PR's on my repo, plus I made a few PR's on a couple of other
projects. [Rabeye](https://github.com/steveYeah/RabEye) (naming things was never my forte) has been running at 
work on our live servers now ever since and currently sits at ~650 downloads a month.

### Open Source
I've never really done a lot of open source work, which I find strange as all software I write these days uses
open source tools and libraries. I'm always amazed at the people that take the time out of there lives to help
other people out and will always be eternally grateful!

A few years back I decided to try to get involved more, which can be tricky to start. I took the approach that
I could no longer complain about something, or make fun of any open source work I see, if I felt I could do 
better then I had to make a PR. This lead me to doing lots of small and not so small fixes over a couple of years.
Last year it was a goal of mine to get my own projects up and running. I had a couple of ideas of things that might 
help other people out and wanted to get them out there. The biggest issue was the time! Where do people find 
the time for this kind of work? Never the less, I managed to get my first two projects live:

* [Rabeye](https://github.com/steveYeah/RabEye) - A RabbitMQ monitor (as we spoke about earlier) 
* [PyBomb](https://github.com/steveYeah/PyBomb) - A simple and clean API client for the GiantBomb API

Both were hard work, even though they were both simple, but I learned a lot about how to get your code out there
and I am very proud that I managed it and they are now being used by people. They will continue to grow and 
improve over the years too, as long as they are useful to someone.

### Swag!
Earlier this week my Hacktoberfest T-shirt arrived! I even got a few stickers from the guys at GitHub too.
Thanks to the guys at Digital Ocean and GitHub for setting this up. Looks like a lot of people got involved 
which is great for the open source community! I'm looking forward to next year!
